# StatusBot

StatusBot is a simple discord bot that PM's a user if another bot goes offline. It comes with a very simple per-server configuration that
determines what bot will be tracked for its status, and who will be PM'ed when the bot goes offline. So far this bot is only for testing
purposes only. If you are interested in using it, either visit it's development [discord server](https://discord.gg/GRBeCAX) and message me, or PM me on discord for
further info.
